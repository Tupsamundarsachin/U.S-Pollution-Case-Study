# U.S-Pollution-Case-Study
This project focuses on analyzing pollution levels across the United States and their impact on daily life. A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize and understand pollution metrics, including carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels. Additionally, the dashboard provides insights into population distribution on a quarterly basis.


PROBLEM ATATEMENT:
This project aims to address the following questions and also Understanding the distribution and concentration of various pollutants is crucial for identifying problem areas, assessing public health risks, and implementing effective policies and measures.
1. What are the levels of carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in each state of the U.S.?
2. How do these pollution levels vary geographically and temporally?
3. What is the impact of these pollutants on the population across different states and quarters of the year?


APPROACH:
To tackle these questions, the following approach was taken:

1. Data Collection: Collected data on pollution levels for CO, O3, SO2, and NO2 across various states in the U.S. Also, gathered data on population distribution for quarterly analysis.
2. Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency, handling any missing or erroneous values.
3. Dashboard Creation: Developed a Power BI dashboard to visualize the data:
a) Pollution Levels: Created visualizations for the levels of CO, O3, SO2, and NO2 in each state. This helps in understanding the concentration and distribution of these pollutants.
b) Quarterly Population Distribution: Provided a breakdown of the population by quarter, allowing for an analysis of how pollution levels correlate with population changes throughout the year.
c) Geographical Analysis: Included maps and charts to display the geographic distribution of pollution levels, highlighting areas with the highest and lowest pollution levels.

4. Analysis and Insights: Analyzed the visualizations to draw insights on pollution trends, identify high-risk areas, and assess the potential impact on public health. This analysis helps in understanding regional disparities and guiding policy decisions.

CONCLUSION:
The U.S. Pollution Analysis Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of pollution levels across the country, providing valuable insights into how different pollutants vary by state and over time. By visualizing key metrics and trends, the dashboard helps stakeholders and policymakers make informed decisions to address pollution issues and improve public health. The inclusion of quarterly population data further enriches the analysis, allowing for a deeper understanding of how pollution impacts different demographic segments throughout the year.
